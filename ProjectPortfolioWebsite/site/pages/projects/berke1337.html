          <p>
          The team competes in the Western Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition each year, in addition to a variety of smaller offensive security competitions. In our meetings we practice hands-on security in both offensive and defensive roles. Past practices have involved reversing custom-built Windows malware, setting up a network intrusion monitor with any Linux machine in less than 5 minutes, and cracking ciphers for security capture-the-flag competitions.
          </p>
          <h3 class="head2">CCDC</h3>
          <p>
          BERKE1337 was originally founded as a team to compete in the Western Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition. Since its inception, the team has grown, but this competition is still one of BERKE1337's biggest events. In this competition, our team of eight is given a network of approximately 20 servers and workstations which must be secured against constant attack from a professional security team. Simultaneously, we must complete objectives given to us by the competition organizers, such as setting up new roles for servers or reconfiguring network topology. The 1st place in the regionals advances to the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition.
          </p>
          <h3 class="head2">Capture the Flag Competitions</h3>
          <p>
          CTF contests are usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine, as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world. Reverse-engineering, network sniffing, protocol analysis, system administration, programming, and cryptanalysis are all skills which can be useful in a CTF.

          BERKE1337 competes in several CTFs throughout the year, the two biggest being the MITRE and CSAW CTFs.
          </p>
          <h3 class="head2">Workshops</h3>
          <p>
          Throughout the year, BERKE1337 holds many workshops and practices so members can gain key knowledge in computer security. Workshops range in subject matter and skill level. Examples of past workshop topics include firewalls, malware, and intrusion detection systems.
