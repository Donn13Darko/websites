          <p>
          The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Cal offers students unique opportunities to pursue projects in aeronautics and astronautics. Although UC Berkeley does not have an aerospace engineering major, AIAA provides many students with the resources to pursue and satisfy these interests. The professional division of AIAA hosts various technical talks, infosessions with NASA and aerospace companies, as well as internship panels and professional development workshops for our members.
          </p>

          <p>
          Cal AIAA acts as an umbrella organization to support our two applied aerospace and mechanical engineering divisions: a NASA Sponsored Robo-Ops Competition Team, and a Cessna-Raytheon Sponsored Design, Build, and Fly (DBF) UAV Competition Team. Past initiatives include partnering with the ESA to build a prototype CubeSAT micro-satellite, founding a Learn to Fly: Private Pilot Ground School University-Sponsored course, as well as working alongside the SESB to promote Space Exploration.
          </p>

          <p>
          The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics National Association was created in 1963 through the merger of the American Rocket Society and the Institute of Aerospace Sciences. AIAA’s role today is to represent the interests of its community of 35,000 individual members as well as to provide younger members with hands-on experience through competitions and seminars.
          </p>

          <p>
          The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Berkeley will serve to provide members of the University of California at Berkeley community with education, experience, and opportunity in fields such as but not limited to aeronautics, astronautics, aerospace engineering, and aeronautical engineering through ranges of activities that will promote leadership, professional development, and innovation.
